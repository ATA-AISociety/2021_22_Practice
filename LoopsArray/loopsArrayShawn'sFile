## Oh no! Someone has filled my list (which was supposed to collect the number of pets everyone had) with strings and decimal numbers. 
## Please fix this by removing all invalid inputs from the list (maybe find a way to use a loop for this, hint hint)
## Then order all remaining elements of the list least to greatest
## Finally, use a while loop to make sure that an input statement only accepts whole number integers
## Thank you coders
