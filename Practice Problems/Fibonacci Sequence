# Write a program that N number of Fibonnaci numbers where N equals the user input

#Objective:useing functions and user input

#*Tip: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,

# Aaron Ba

import math
Phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
phi = (1 - math.sqrt(5)) / 2
userInput = int(input("To what number in the fibonacci sequence do you want to see? "))
equation = ((Phi ** userInput) - (phi ** userInput)) / math.sqrt(5)
print(int(equation))

# End

numOfNums = int(input("How many Fibonnaci seqence numbers? "))
sequence = [1,1]
ctrl = 2;
while (ctrl < numOfNums):
  sequence.append(sequence[ctrl-1]+sequence[ctrl-2])
  ctrl += 1
print(sequence[numOfNums-1])
#End
